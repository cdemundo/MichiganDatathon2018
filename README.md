# MichiganDatathon2018

I came in second place in the Michigan Ross Datathon for 2018 with a team of 3 other Ross MBA students.  We were tasked with utilizing datasets of US domestic flight traffic, flight fares, and weather (and any external datasets we wanted) to pose and answer our own questions. 

The question I explored was: Do delays have any effect on customer willingness to pay?  

I first explored delays caused by airports (holding airline and route distance constant) and found no relationship. 

I then explored, holding airlines constant, are fares lower on routes with longer airline-caused delays?  I also found no relationship here. 

We concluded that this lack of relationship is potentially due to constraint on supply for consumers and time constraints when picking flights.  For airline executives, it is likely delays will not have a large impact on consumer WTP and resources should be focused elsewhere.  

I would like to further explore this question, potentially comparing similar routes, agnostic of airline, and seeing if inter-route delays have any relationship with fares charged for the routes.
